# FBI Return A

(just a stub for now)

This writeup and data wrangling is heavily indebted to and derived from BuzzFeed News and The Trace's work here:

Particularly this methodology

https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5692683-Methodology-for-National-Analysis-of-Clearance.html

The purpose of this repo-write up will be to explore and repeat the steps in the methodology, while building a useable database of FBI Return A data.


## Notes from the methodology

(Page 8, Overview of Data Sources)

> The FBI’s Return A data (“Monthly Return of Offenses Known to the Police”) is the most commonly cited federal source on crime statistics. It is the most nationally-representative, but least detailed, of the three federal datasets analyzed here.

> Law enforcement agencies voluntarily send monthly offense and clearance totals to the FBI, either directly or through a state agency. (Although the program is voluntary, the vast majority of larger-city agencies do report Return A data, and most have provided it consistently since the 1960s.) The offenses are classified into 27 categories, including murder and aggravated assaults involving a firearm. The FBI then checks the numbers for consistency and validity — sometimes requesting that agencies fix or explain apparent discrepancies — and then compiles the data into annual files.
